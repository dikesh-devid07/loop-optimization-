The Loop Optimization Demo project is designed to demonstrate how different loop structures (for loop and while loop) work in the C programming language while performing the same task. The program converts a given number of seconds into hours, minutes, and seconds and counts the number of iterations executed by each loop.

This project helps in understanding loop behavior, iteration count, performance comparison, and basic time conversion logic, which are essential concepts in programming.



. The main aim of this project is:

To convert a given number of seconds into hours, minutes, and seconds

To implement the conversion using both for loops and while loops

To count and compare the number of iterations performed by each loop

To demonstrate the concept of loop optimization

To analyze which loop performs fewer or more iterations for the same task


Used in timers, clocks, system time calculations, embedded systems, and performance analysis.
